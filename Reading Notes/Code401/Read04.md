# Classes and Objects
Objects are an encapsulation of variables and functions into a single entity. Objects get their variables and functions from classes. Classes are essentially a template to create your objects.

A very basic class would look something like this:

```html
class MyClass:
    variable = "blah"

    def function(self):
        print("This is a message inside the class.")
```

# Thinking Recursively in Python
Problems (in life and also in computer science) can often seem big and scary. But if we keep chipping away at them, more often than not we can break them down into smaller chunks trivial enough to solve. This is the essence of thinking recursively, and my aim in this article is to provide you, my dear reader, with the conceptual tools necessary to approach problems from this recursive point of view.

Together, we’ll learn how to work with recursion in our Python programs by mastering concepts such as recursive functions and recursive data structures. We’ll also talk about maintaining state during recursion and avoiding recomputation by caching results. This is going to be a lot of fun. Onwards and upwards!

## things I want to learn
learn more about classes concepts and how they work , how to create them and how to use them and how to create objects from them, and learn about the 4 pillars of OOP inheritance, composition, abstraction and polymorphism.
