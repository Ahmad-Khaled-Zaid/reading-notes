## Arrow functions
The arrow function expression syntax is a shorter way of creating a function expression. Arrow functions do not have their own this, do not have prototypes, cannot be used for constructors, and should not be used as object methods.
## Template literals
Concatenation/string interpolation
Expressions can be embedded in template literal strings.

## returns
The return keyword is implied and can be omitted if using arrow functions without a block body.
## Destructuring (object matching)
Use curly brackets to assign properties of an object to their own variable.
