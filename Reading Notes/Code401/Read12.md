# Pandas 
pandas is a Python package providing fast, flexible, and expressive data structures designed to make working with “relational” or “labeled” data both easy and intuitive. It aims to be the fundamental high-level building block for doing practical, real-world data analysis in Python.
Customarily, we import as follows:

import numpy as np

import pandas as pd

## What kind of data does pandas handle?¶
Tabular data with heterogeneously-typed columns, as in an SQL table or Excel spreadsheet

Ordered and unordered (not necessarily fixed-frequency) time series data.

Arbitrary matrix data (homogeneously typed or heterogeneous) with row and column labels

Any other form of observational / statistical data sets. The data need not be labeled at all to be placed into a pandas data structure
