# What is serverless?

Serverless is a cloud computing application development and execution model that enables developers to build and run application code without provisioning or managing servers or backend infrastructure.

## Serverless does not mean 'no servers'

The name notwithstanding, there are most definitely servers in serverless computing. 'Serverless' describes the developer’s experience with those servers—they are are invisible to the developer, who doesn't see them, manage them, or interact with them in any way.

Serverless lets developers put all their focus into writing the best front-end application code and business logic they can. All developers need to do is write their application code and deploy it to containers managed by a cloud service provider. The cloud provider handles the rest, provisioning the cloud infrastructure required to run the code and scaling the infrastructure up and down on demand as needed. The cloud provider is also responsible for all routine infrastructure management and maintenance such as operating system updates and patches, security management, capacity planning, system monitoring and more.

## Pros and cons of serverless

- Pros  
  Given all of the preceding, it should be no surprise that serverless computing offers a number of technical and business benefits to individual developers and enterprise development teams.

- Improved developer productivity:  
  As noted above, serverless enables development teams to focus on writing code, not managing infrastructure. It gives developers much more time to innovate and optimize their front-end application functionality and business logic.

- Pay for execution only:  
  The meter starts when the request is made, and ends when execution finishes. Compare this to the infrastructure as a service (IaaS) compute model, where customers pay for the physical servers, virtual machines (VMs) and other resources required to run applications, from the time they provision those resources until the time they explicitly decommission them.

- Develop in any language:  
  Serverless is a polyglot environment, enabling developers to code in any language or framework—Java, Python, JavaScript, node.js—with which they're comfortable.

- Streamlined development/DevOps cycles:  
  Serverless simplifies deployment and, in a larger sense, simplifies DevOps because developers don't spend time defining infrastructure required to integrate, test, deliver and deploy code builds into production.

- Cost-effective performance  
  For certain workloads—embarrassingly parallel processing, stream processing, certain data processing tasks—serverless computing can be both faster and more cost-effective than other forms of compute.
