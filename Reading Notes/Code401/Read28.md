# Django Tutorial Part 9: Working with forms  
An HTML Form is a group of one or more fields/widgets on a web page, which can be used to collect information from users for submission to a server. Forms are a flexible mechanism for collecting user input because there are suitable widgets for entering many different types of data, including text boxes, checkboxes, radio buttons, date pickers and so on. Forms are also a relatively secure way of sharing data with the server, as they allow us to send data in POST requests with cross-site request forgery protection.  

## URL mapping  
Open /catalog/urls.py and copy in the line setting the path for 'books/', as shown below. Just as for the index page, this path() function defines a pattern to match against the URL ('books/'), a view function that will be called if the URL matches (views.BookListView.as_view()), and a name for this particular mapping.  

## View (class-based)  
We could quite easily write the book list view as a regular function (just like our previous index view), which would query the database for all books, and then call render() to pass the list to a specified template. Instead, however, we're going to use a class-based generic list view (ListView) â€” a class that inherits from an existing view. Because the generic view already implements most of the functionality we need and follows Django best-practice, we will be able to create a more robust list view with less code, less repetition, and ultimately less maintenance.
